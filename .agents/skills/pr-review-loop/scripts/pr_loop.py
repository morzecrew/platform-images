"""Supporting tool for the pr-review-loop skill (GitHub via `gh` CLI, stdlib only).

Replaces hand-crafted API calls for the loop's mechanical steps:

  status   <pr>   one-shot snapshot: checks bucketed clean/pending/attention,
                  reviewers discovered (bots vs humans), unresolved thread count
  wait     <pr>   bounded poll until every check completes *and* the comment
                  count stops moving (step 1) — a reviewer's check often goes
                  green before its review is posted, so completion alone is not
                  the signal. Optionally require named reviewers to have spoken.
  collect  <pr>   every review thread (fully paginated, both levels), review
                  bodies, and issue comments, normalized to one JSON doc (step 2)
  react           👍/👎 on a comment, review or issue surface (step 5)
  reply    <pr>   in-thread reply to a review comment (step 5)
  resolve         resolve a review thread by GraphQL thread id (step 5, bots only)

Read subcommands are safe anywhere; react/reply/resolve write to the PR.
All output on stdout is JSON; progress goes to stderr.

Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 usage/gh error · 2 wait saw attention-needed conclusions ·
3 wait timed out (on checks, on comments settling, or on an expected reviewer).
Unknown flags exit 2, from argparse itself.

Requires: `gh` installed and authenticated. Repo comes from the cwd, or
--repo owner/name.

The skill's judgment (verdicts, dedup into findings, human-vs-bot etiquette,
never-merge) stays in SKILL.md — this tool only makes the mechanics reliable.
