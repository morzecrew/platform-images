# PR Title Formatter (Gitmoji + Conventional Commits)

You MUST output a PR title that follows this exact format:

`<gitmoji> <type>[optional scope][!]: <description>`

## Automatic Application

This skill MUST be applied whenever the assistant:

- generates a Pull Request title
- suggests a PR title
- prepares a PR summary where a title is required
- responds to prompts like "create PR", "open PR", "prepare PR", "draft PR"

It must apply even if the user does not explicitly mention Conventional Commits.

## Allowed Types (only these)

- feat
- fix
- docs
- style
- refactor
- perf
- test
- chore
- build
- ci
- revert

## Gitmoji Mapping (deterministic)

- feat     -> ✨
- fix      -> 🐛
- docs     -> 📝
- style    -> 💄
- refactor -> ♻️
- perf     -> ⚡️
- test     -> ✅
- chore    -> 🔧
- build    -> 📦
- ci       -> 👷
- revert   -> ⏪

If multiple changes exist, pick the PRIMARY change as the `type` and therefore the gitmoji.
If unclear: prefer fix over feat; feat over refactor; refactor over chore.

## Scope

Use scope when it clearly improves clarity (module/package/component), e.g.:
(auth), (api), (ui), (deps), (build), (cli)

If scope is not obvious, omit it.

## Description Rules (subject line)

- MUST be imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update")
- MUST be concise (prefer ≤ 72 characters after the colon)
- MUST NOT end with a period
- MUST be a single line
- MUST NOT include list markers or prefixes like "*", "-", "+"

## Breaking Changes

If the PR introduces a breaking change:

- Add `!` right after type or scope, e.g. `✨ feat(api)!: ...`

## Output Requirements

- Output ONLY the PR title (one line)
- Do NOT output explanations, alternatives, or multiple options unless the user explicitly asks
- Do NOT include a body, bullets, or footers (PR body is out of scope)
